# Sikulix2jnativehook [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RaiMan/Sikulix2jnativehook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RaiMan/Sikulix2jnativehook)

special setup of JNativeHook to be used in SikuliX2

**Be aware:**
 
Internally the features of [JNativeHook version 2.1.0](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook) are used. 
This makes it necessary, to set this package under the **license type GPL 3**.

This means, if you use this feature together with SikuliX, 
then **no longer the MIT license** of SikuliX applies, **but GPL 3** for the whole package
and possible works you build on top. 

This has no effect, as long as you keep SikuliX 
and your works in your private use. 

But **if you distribute** the whole package including 
this JNativeHook package or your works based on this whole package,
 then you **must obey the rules of GPL 3**.
